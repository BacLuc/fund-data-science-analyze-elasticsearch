    "The first task is to get an overview of the author ownership of the _elasticsearch_ project. In particular, we want to understand who are the main authors in the system between the two considered tags, the authors distribution among files and the files distribution among authors. To this aim, perform the following:\n",
    "- create a dictionary (or a list of tuples) with the pairs author => number of modified files\n",
    "- create a dictionary (or a list of tuples) with the pairs file => number of authors who modified the file\n",
    "- visualize the distribution of authors among files: the visualization should have on the x axis the number of authors per file (from 1 to max), and on the y axis the number of files with the given number of authors (so for example the first bar represent the number of files with single author)\n",
    "- visualize the distribution of files among authors: the visualization should have on the x axis the number of files per author (from 1 to max), and on the y axis the number of authors who modified the given number of files (so for example the first bar represent the minor contributors, i.e., the number of authors who changed only 1 file)\n",

    "3. `src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/action`\n",

To compute the value at the package level, you should aggregate the data per file.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "We now want to analyze the knowledge loss when the main contributor of the analyzed project would leave. For this we will use the circle packaging layout introduced in the \"Code as a Crime Scene\" book. It should show how much of each file was written by the main contributor of _elasticsearch_ (according to the analysis above using `Modification.TOTAL`) and indicate which areas would be affected most when this contributor leaves the project. This assignment includes the necessary `knowledge_loss.html` file as well as the `d3` folder with the d3 dependencies. Your task is to create the `output.json` file according to the specification below. This file can then be visualized with the files provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "For showing the visualization, once you have the output as `output.json` you should\n",
    "* make sure to have the `knowledge_loss.html` file in the same folder\n",
    "* start a local HTTP server in the same folder (e.g. with python `python3 -m http.server`, serving necessary for d3)\n",
    "* open the served `knowledge_loss.html` and look at the visualization\n",
